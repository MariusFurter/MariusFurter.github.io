  abstract     = {This report describes a method for modeling free and forced choice within Co-Design. In a free choice among a set, one has control over which option is selected, while in a forced choice one does not. Given a preorder P describing resources or functionalities, a free choice among a subset of P acts like a meet. Dually, a forced choice acts like a join. Moreover, the two types of choice distribute over one another. Based on this, we construct a universal model for choice on a preorder using the free completely distributive lattice ULP. Feasibility relations are then extended to these models. Along the way, we illustrate how to work within ULP and provide results that simplify calculations. The definitions presented here have been implemented in Haskell.},

  abstract = {The recent success achieved by immune checkpoint inhibitors in the field of immuno-oncology has been less evident for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients. To date, cancer immunotherapy has been efficacious only in few patients bearing high mutational burden (less than 25\%) mCRCs. In this Communication, we report the generation of a novel antibody cytokine fusion protein (termed Sm3E-mIL12) targeting the CRC-associated carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). The antibody moiety bound avidly to CEA when immobilized on solid supports, and selectively stained C51 tumor cells transfected with the antigen (C51-CEA). The cytokine payload retained full activity in vitro, as compared to the parental recombinant interleukin-12 (IL12). Ex vivo microscopic analyses revealed a homogenous distribution of Sm3E-mIL12 in the neoplastic mass upon intravenous administration. In vivo, Sm3E-mIL12 was well tolerated up to 180 Âµg per mouse. The targeted delivery of IL12 to CEA-expressing C51 carcinomas led to durable complete responses in 60\% of the treated mice. The intratumoral density of immune effector cells was markedly increased after the third injection of Sm3E-mIL12, in keeping with the progressive regression of the neoplastic mass. The data suggest that a fully human analogue may be considered for the treatment of patients with mCRC.},
