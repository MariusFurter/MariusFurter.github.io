I am a third year PhD student in Mathematics, advised by [Prof. Alberto Cattaneo](https://www.math.uzh.ch/people?semId=30&key1=116) at the University of Zurich. I am funded by the [Digital Society Initiative Excellence Program Scholarship](https://www.dsi.uzh.ch/en/education/excellence-program.html). I hold a Masters in Interdisciplinary Sciences (Biology and Chemistry) from ETH and a Bachelors in Mathematics from the University of Zurich.

My PhD aims at making probabilistic modeling and inference more widely accessible to scientists. This involves finding more intuitive and unified theoretical foundations, producing software tools that abstract away mathematical details, and writing clear exposition. Currently, I'm developing a framework for model building, inference, and experimental design for dynamic system biology models based on category theory and probabilistic programming.

I am also interested in [monotone co-design](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.08055). In 2025, I visited [Gioele Zardini](https://gioele.science) at MIT to incorporate probabilistic uncertainty into co-design. Before that, work with [Jonathan Lorand](https://lorand.earth/math) resulted in a semester paper on modeling choice in co-design.

I enjoy teaching and creating math video lectures. You can find my teaching materials [here](/teaching).
